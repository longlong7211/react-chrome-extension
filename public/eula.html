                    includes or
                    uses any third-party property, you have secured all rights, licenses, written consents and

                    old or older.

                    4.2 Leaked content. Gemma will take disciplinary action against any users who maliciously or
                    unintentionally leak any other user's "exclusive content" (defined as 1. any content sent by
                    another user
                    within a private message, or 2. any content that a user posts on their own private,
                    subscriber-only feed).
                    Leak is defined as any intentional or unintentional posting and spreading of exclusive content
                    to any
                    platform or medium, including within Gemma on public feeds or other fan communities. For
                    every individual
                    leak (one piece of content such as one image or one video), accounts that leak content will be
                    fined a fee
                    of $50 per site the content is found on, billed to the last recorded card the leaker has used;
                    <span class="fw-600">we have the
                        right to charge leak fines up to three instances, as we assume any additional leaks may not be
                        by the
                        original leaker. An instance is defined as a leak report submitted.</span> If the leaker does
                    not
                    immediately
                    remove all leaked content from all platforms, we reserve the right to fine the leaker an
                    additional flat fee
                    of $150.

                    4.3 Copyright Disputes and DMCA Takedowns. In the case that a copyright violation occurs and is
                    hosted on
                    the Gemma platform, the copyright owner should contact Gemma's agent to receive
                    notification of
                    infringement, at hello@Gemma.app. The format for requesting such a claim can be found at
                    https://www.copyright.gov/dmca-directory/. Once the claim is validated, Gemma will respond
                    expeditiously
                    to remove, or disable access to, the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the
                    subject of the
                    infringing activity. Gemma itself will be subject to DMCA's infringement safe harbor
                    regulations for
                    online service providers. Please note that, under the DMCA, any person who knowingly makes
                    material
                    misrepresentations in a notification of claimed infringement or in a counter-notification may be
                    liable for
                    damages.

                        5.2.1 Solicitation: Gemma was founded to help creators with existing communities to
                        monetise content.
                        Using Gemma itself to grow your subscriber count by intending to have other people's
                        subscribers sub to
                        you is not its intended use. When you spam or solicit from other users, it lessens the
                        genuine experience of
                        users on the platform, and violates our terms. Acts of solicitation from a creator include:
                        1) Blatantly
                        marketing your Gemma or unprompted social links in other creator's housechats, comments
                        or fanwalls 2)
                        Direct Messaging (DMing) any user not subscribed to you asking them if they'd like to
                        subscribe to you or
                        purchase your content 3) Mass offering other creator's subscribers a free trial to your
                        Gemma/sending
                        them mass free invites out of the blue 4) Mass following or Direct Messaging (DMing) other
                        creator's
                        subscribers If someone is soliciting your subscribers, report it to Gemma here. For the
                        first and second
                        instance of solicitation/spam we pause a creator's account and only unpause once they've
                        confirmed to abide
                        by our terms. Upon a third violation we deactivate the account. We are here to support
                        creators - this means
                        removing users from the platform that are endangering the experience of others, as well as
                        making sure

                        deactivate all
                        accounts that are found to engage in harassment or abusive behavior on Gemma, such as

                        platform. All
                        accounts are traced to the credit card provided, so a user is unable to make a new account
